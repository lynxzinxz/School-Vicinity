            <p><strong>Why did I choose this place to take a photo?</strong> 
         <br><br> I chose this spot at SHS San Nicolas to take a photo of me. This spot is located in
                 front of the registrar's office in the Humss building.
                 It is full of greenest plants and trees, and I would say that it is
                  one of the best spot in our school to take a picture.</p>

                <p><strong>The United Nation Webpage Insights</strong>
            <br><br>For me, while working on my webpage about United Nations. 
                 I learned that it consists of various specialized agencies and programs addressing issues such as humanitarian aid,
                  human rights, and sustainable development. </p>
